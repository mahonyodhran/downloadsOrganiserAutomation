# Downloads Organiser

Simple program to automate manually moving individual files from Downloads folder to other directories with one run.

The program can be run using the automateDownloads.sh file - if you want to you use it you will need to change the directory variables in the Python code itself and the directory of the repo in the shell file.

This is definitely not well done and very rough around the edges, I am not oblivious to the fact that most of the code is basically one method repeated which is (somewhat) easily extracted . . soon!
